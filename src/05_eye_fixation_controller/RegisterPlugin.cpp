/*
 * Strange incomplete type error
 *
 * I was getting a strange incomplete type error when including
 * FixationController.h here. The fixation controller includes the Controller.h
 * file which makes a forward declaration of type Actuator that is passed to the
 * Set<> as a const Actuator. However, the Set object performs some operations
 * that violate the constness. Not sure why this triggered an error that is
 * located in the opensim-core library. However, by including Actuator.h before
 * the FixationController.h seems to solve the problem. This is not necessary
 * when using the fixation controller elsewhere (e.g., see Simulation.cpp).
